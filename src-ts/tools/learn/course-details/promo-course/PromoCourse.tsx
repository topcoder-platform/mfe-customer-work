                    We will be building additional learning path courses, where when taken
                    in sequence, will result in a larger Topcoder certification.
                    These certifications will show in your Topcoder profile and will showcase
                    your verified skills and earned certifications. The resulting outcome is
                    that you have gained essential skills allowing you to be more successful
                    on the Topcoder platform.
