                Before you can claim a verified certification, you must accept our Academic Honesty Pledge, which reads:
            </p>

            <p>
                "I understand that plagiarism means copying someone else’s work and presenting the work as if it were my own,
                without clearly attributing the original author."
            </p>

            <p>
                "I understand that plagiarism is an act of intellectual dishonesty, and that people usually get kicked out of
                Academy or fired from their jobs if they get caught plagiarizing."
            </p>

            <p>
                "Aside from using open source libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap, and short snippets of code which are clearly
                attributed to their original author, 100% of the code in my projects was written by me, or along with another
                person going through the freeCodeCamp curriculum with whom I was pair programming in real time."
            </p>

            <p>
                "I pledge that I did not plagiarize any of my freeCodeCamp.org work. I understand that freeCodeCamp.org's team
                will audit my projects to confirm this."
            </p>

            <p>
                In the situations where we discover instances of unambiguous plagiarism, we will replace the person in question's
                certification with a message that "Upon review, this account has been flagged for academic dishonesty."
            </p>

            <p>
                As an academic institution that grants achievement-based certifications, we take academic honesty very seriously.
                If you have any questions about this policy, or suspect that someone has violated it, you can email team@freecodecamp.org
                and we will investigate.
            </p>
