# Topcoder Self Service Micro Frontend App

This is a [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) example React microapp.

> NOTE. This application have been configured to be run as child app of a single-spa application. So while this app can be deployed and run independently, we would need some frame [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) which would load it. While technically we can achieve running this app as standalone app it's strongly not recommended by the author of the `single-spa` approch, see this [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa/issues/640) for details.

## Requirements

- node - v10.22.1

## Local Deployment

Inside the project folder run:

- `nvm use 10.22.1;` - to use npm version: 10.22.1
- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm run local` - run app in `development` mode and `dev` config
- This app will be loaded as a normal MFE app, its url is `http://localhost:8519/self-service/topcoder-mfe-customer-work.js` and is configurated in the config file of Self Service App

## Deployment to Production

- `npm i` - install dependencies
- `npm build` - build code to `dist/` folder
- Now you can host `dist/` folder using any static server. For example, you may run a simple `Express` server by running `npm start`.

### Deploying to Heroku

Make sure you have [Heroky CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed and you have a Heroku account. And then inside the project folder run the next commands:

- If there is not Git repository inited yet, create a repo and commit all the files:

  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m'inital commit'`

- `heroku apps:create` - create Heroku app

- `git push heroku master` - push changes to Heroku and trigger deploying

- Now you have to configure frame app to use the URL provided by Heroku like `https://<APP-NAME>.herokuapp.com/gigs-app/topcoder-mfe-customer-work.js` to load this microapp.

### Aggregator API

Please refer to [Swagger Doc](./src/api/docs/swagger.yaml) for Aggregator API endpoints

#### Aggregator API Configuration

In the `mfe-customer-work` root directory create `.env` file with the next environment variables.

```bash
# Auth0 config
AUTH_SECRET=
AUTH0_URL=
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
VALID_ISSUERS=
```

Once the self service app is started, the aggregator api will work as well
